  storyText: 'You ask the janitor where you are. He turns around, looks at you, and
    shrugs while saying "You are here at the motel" then he turns around again, walks
    up to the next room and says "something is not right here" and unlocks the door
    and goes in. When the door is open, there is bright light coming out of the room.
    The janitor walks in, and you are not sure if that was a scream you just heard
    or a very creaky door. And did his hammer have blood on it?
