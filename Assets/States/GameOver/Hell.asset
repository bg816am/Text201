  storyText: You go through the door, and the door automatically closes behind you,
    almost forcing you in. You turn around, but the door is gone. Just an eerie twilight
    darkness. You see an orange light, almost like a flame in the distance, and you
    are drawn towards it, and without thinking start walking. And it is starting
    to get really warm in here.
