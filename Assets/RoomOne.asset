  storyText: 'You look around. The shades are drawn, its dark, but it looks just
    like a cheap motel. No TV, one creaky bed, a night stand, and a desk. No light
    comes in from the outside, must still be late. The only light is from the table
    lamp that you figure you must of left on. You did, didn''t you?


    Now what
    to do?

    1. Check out the night stand.

    2. Take a look at the desk.

    3.
    Leave the room.'
