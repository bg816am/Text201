  storyText: 'You drawn the chain lock and step out into the hallway. The hallway
    is barely lit,  and smells musty. There are many rooms going both up and down
    the hallway. You can not hear any noise coming in either direction, just a steady
    mechanical hum of nothingness. There is a light on down to the right, maybe a
    front desk?


    What next?

    1. Head towards the front desk

    2. Go back
    in your room.

    3.Look around down other way of the hallway.'
